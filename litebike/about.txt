Overview
This project presents an innovative solution for modern bicycle security with a Tap-to-Unlock Lock System. Utilizing NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, the lock offers seamless keyless unlocking, enhanced security features, and a sleek, user-friendly design. It integrates advanced components like an LED feedback system, a motorized locking mechanism, and anti-theft alarms to meet the needs of cyclists. With added features like manual unlocking and AirTag compatibility for GPS tracking, this system ensures both convenience and reliability.

The design process involved extensive prototyping, user feedback studies, and risk assessments to refine functionality and ensure market readiness. This smart lock exemplifies modern security solutions, blending advanced technology with practical usability.

Key Objectives
Develop a secure and intuitive NFC-based locking system.
Incorporate user-friendly features like LED feedback and auditory alerts.
Address potential risks like tampering, weather resistance, and battery failure.
Validate the design through prototyping, testing, and user feedback.
Methodology
The project was executed in the following phases:

Conceptual Design: Initial sketches and CAD models defined the form and function of the lock.
Prototyping: Low-fidelity 3D-printed models evaluated alignment, fit, and aesthetics, leading to iterative improvements.
Electronics Integration: The locking mechanism uses an actuator nut driven by a stepper motor, controlled by an RFID module, to secure the U-lock in place. LED indicators and a compact speaker enhance user feedback.
User Testing: A survey collected feedback on usability, design, and suggested improvements, providing valuable insights for refinement.
The system’s core is its NFC unlocking capability, compatible with smartphone wallets like Apple Wallet. A manual key backup ensures usability in technical or power failure scenarios. Anti-theft alarms and AirTag GPS integration offer added security and peace of mind.

Highlights & Results
User Feedback: Most users praised the convenience of the tap-to-unlock feature and the sleek design. Suggestions for improving weather resistance and adding sound/LED feedback were noted for future iterations.
Prototyping Insights: 3D printing revealed tolerance issues, prompting adjustments to improve mechanical alignment.
Business Viability: The product received positive reception, with a projected price range of $60–$120 depending on added features like weatherproofing or app integration.
Enhanced Security: Features include a motorized locking mechanism, encryption-based NFC unlocking, and anti-theft alarms.
Future Scope
Planned improvements include:

Enhancing weatherproofing to withstand outdoor conditions.
Incorporating tamper-proof manual unlocking for added security.
Adding app-based features like remote unlocking, status alerts, and user tutorials.
User Study Insights
Pros:

Convenient NFC unlocking eliminates the need for keys.
Sleek, modern design complements bicycle aesthetics.
Backup manual unlocking ensures reliability.
Cons:

Weather resistance needs improvement.
LED and sound feedback systems were absent in the prototype.
The manual unlocking port could be more seamlessly integrated.
This project demonstrates a commitment to delivering cutting-edge solutions for bicycle security, combining practicality, advanced technology, and user-centric design.
